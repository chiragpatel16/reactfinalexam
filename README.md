📋 Overview

This project is essentially a React-based assignment or examination project. The goal is to integrate various React concepts, UI elements, and design principles into a working application that illustrates the author’s React knowledge. The markdown file in the repo sets out the examination specification, requirements, and perhaps tasks to be completed.
